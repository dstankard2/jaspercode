Bug:
	If you add a component that references and updates a shared object, other dependencies of that shared object are not reloaded.

If there is a change in ignore files (jasper.properties), ignored files should be removed from output.

Dependencies in Build Context
	Add ID to build component.  Make it required.
	When a dependency is defined, search the application's build contexts before adding a dependency via build component.

Variable Types should be on a per-build-context basis instead of per-language
Analysis: A build context should have a language?
	Won't work for some embed Tomcat applications - do not support?
	Perhaps assign a primary language for a build context?

(??) Maven build should not require maven.java.version.  Evaluate that at preprocessing time.

Re-enable plugins
Enable monitor plugin.  It should generate a HTML page.
