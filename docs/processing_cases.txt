Cases for modifying existing component files and user files

Definitions:
Application Data: system attributes, variable types, source files
Item: A unit that must be handled in processing
Folder Watcher: An item that is informed as user files are added/removed
Configurable: An item that needs some type of processing to modify application data.
Build: A configurable that represents the build required in a folder
Processable: A configurable that can take configurations and must be processed to produce application data.
Component: A Processable that is a component either added in a component file or added by another build/processable.
FileWatcher: A processable that handles changes in a single file.

Data:
	toProcess: A set of configurables to process
	buildsToInit: A set of builds that need to be initialized
	buildsToProcess: A set of builds to process, which have already been initialized

Rules: 
Permanent unload ItemId: 
	Unload all application data for an itemId.  Remove it from items and toProcess.
	Remove any item that originates from this one.
	Unload and reload the item that this originates from.
Unload and reAdd itemId:
	Permanent unload itemId.
	Add item.
Add item:
	Add item to toProcess or buildsToInit.
	Add item to items.
Run Processing: Perform these steps.  Stop if an error is encountered:
	Init builds in buildsToInit.  For each build successfully handled, add it to buildsToProcess.
	Run processables in toProcess
	Process builds in buildsToProcess



Application scan cases from example1



* Modify data object component A in a component file src/main/jaspercode/module/librarian/dataObjects.xml
	Preconditions:
		dataObjects.xml is loaded already
		A is loaded as item 1
		Other items [n] depend on item 1
	Steps:
		Unload item 1 permanently.  Find set [n]
		Unload [n] for re-add
	Post condition: 



* Modify build component at /build-comp.xml
	Preconditions: 
		Items [n] are loaded in /**
	Steps:
		Unload all component files in / recursively



* Modify source file src/main/java/**/*.java

* Modify file in src/main/jaspercode/templates/pages/LibrarianPortalPage.html

* Modify a component in a file that changes application data
